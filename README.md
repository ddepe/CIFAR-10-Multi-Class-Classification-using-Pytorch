CIFAR-10 Multi-Class Classification using Pytorch

Two approaches to Multi-Class classification using Pytorch.

The Multilayer Perceptron approach could reach 60% accuracy. This was done with 7 linear layers.

The Convolutional Neural Net approach could reach 85% accuracy. This was done with 4 CNN layers and 3 linear layers.
It also had the additional constraint of no Maxpooling layers.

The loss used in both approaches was Cross Entropy Loss.

This was an assignment(HW3) in UCLA's CS260 Machine Learning Algorithms
